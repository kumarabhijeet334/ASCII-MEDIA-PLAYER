# Contribution guidelines

Thank you for showing your interest in the repository and the idea. I am grateful to be working with fellow developers.

## Raising Issues

When raising an issue, try your best to include the following information:

- Which branch were you using when things broke?
- What was your input?
- What was the throwback/error message received, if any?
- In case of no error message, how was the output different from expected?
- Was the problem in video rendering/subtitle display/video controls?
- What was the expected output?

If some information is not available to you, you should mention that too.

## Responding to issues

*When contributing, you can contribute to any branch.
The issues page will give you a list of issues you can resolve in the main branch.*

When contributing code to repository, kindly use modularised code. 
Don't worry too much about the code style. The project is in the nascent stage, and code style is
not a worry at the point.

In your pull request, kindly mention the following
- The issue/problem you resolve
- An overview/high level idea of your solution
- Dependencies of your solution
- Caveats/known drawbacks of your solution, if any

Solutions with fewer dependencies will always be appreciated.
